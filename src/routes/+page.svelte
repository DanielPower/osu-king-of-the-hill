<h1>Welcome to King of The Hill</h1>
<p>
	This is a work in progress. The goal is to have a rotating map which is considered the "hill".
	Players will compete for the highest score on that map during a fixed time period when a new map
	becomes the hill. Whenever the map rotates, whichever player has the highest score will gain a
	point.
